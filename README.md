This is simple app which I use react

Unfulfilled:

I failed to make the buttons for the navigation menu. In my opinion :).

Discounted price.

Ratings ‘stars’.

Errors related to CSS.

Fulfilled:
Basically I was able to make most of the content on the page as well as the functionality.

Filtering mechanism.

Sorting mechanism.

Load More Button.

For example data I use JSON.

I use useEffect to get the data.

I use useState and prop drilling to get the final results.

The challenge for me was the load more button. That was the first thing I did and I think it worked. Making the sorting and filtering mechanism was also a bit of a challenge, but it worked. The short time, which is my fault, was the biggest challenge.
