# fly_shop
This is simple app which I use react

How to start project:

- Open project and start command: `npm i`
- After that start command: `cd fly_shop`
- Again start command: `npm i`
- And after that start the project with command: `npm start`

I manage to do about 85% of the tast. In my opinio :).
**Unfulfilled:**

- I failed to make the buttons for the navigation menu.
- Discounted price.
- Ratings ‘stars’.
- Errors related to CSS.


**Fulfilled:**

- Basically I was able to make most of the content on the page as well as the functionality.
- Filtering mechanism.
- Sorting mechanism.
- Load More Button.

For example data I use JSON.

I use useEffect to get the data.

I use useState and prop drilling to get the final results.

The challenge for me was the load more button. That was the first thing I did and I think it worked. Making the sorting and filtering mechanism was also a bit of a challenge, but it worked. The short time, which is my fault, was the biggest challenge.
